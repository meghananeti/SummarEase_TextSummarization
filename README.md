# SummarEase_TextSummarization

Project Overview:
In today’s fast-paced, data-driven world, researchers and professionals face an overwhelming volume of information. This project addresses the challenge of information overload by exploring Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms to condense extensive textual data into meaningful summaries. The goal is to develop a system capable of accurately and efficiently summarizing large texts, such as scientific papers, using both extractive and abstractive summarization techniques.

The project compares various NLP algorithms and models, assessing their accuracy, speed, and ability to generate contextually rich summaries. This research aims to alleviate the burden of managing large datasets and provide practical tools for researchers and professionals.

Key Objectives:
Summarization Efficiency: Evaluate the time and accuracy of different NLP algorithms for automated text summarization.
Extractive & Abstractive Methods: Explore both extractive (sentence extraction) and abstractive (rephrasing) approaches.
Feature Enhancements: Introduce text-to-speech and language translation features for enhanced accessibility and usability.

Methodology:
1. Text Extraction:
The project begins with extracting textual content from PDF documents using Python’s PyMuPDF library. This forms the foundation for the subsequent stages of the summarization process.

2. Extractive Summarization:
The extractive summarization approach focuses on selecting significant sentences from the original text to create a concise summary. This project implements several algorithms:
TextRank: A graph-based algorithm inspired by Google's PageRank, where sentences are nodes and edges represent semantic similarity.
LexRank: Another graph-based algorithm that ranks sentences based on their similarity to others in the text.
LSA (Latent Semantic Analysis): An unsupervised technique that uses singular value decomposition (SVD) to identify semantically meaningful sentences.
Luhn: A frequency-based algorithm that scores sentences based on term significance using TF-IDF.

3. Abstractive Summarization:
Abstractive summarization involves generating new sentences that paraphrase the original content. This project explores the following models:
T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer): A transformer model that treats summarization as a translation task.
BART (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformer): A sequence-to-sequence transformer model known for generating coherent, contextually accurate summaries.

5. BLEU Metrics for Evaluation:
To evaluate the quality of generated summaries, the BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) score is used. This metric measures the overlap between the machine-generated summary and reference summaries, providing a quantitative measure of accuracy.

Additional Features:
1. Text-to-Speech (TTS):
Using the gTTS library, the project integrates a text-to-speech feature that converts summarized content into audio, making it accessible for auditory consumption. This is particularly beneficial for users with visual impairments or those multitasking.

2. Language Translation:
The system leverages the Googletrans library to translate summarized content into various languages, extending its usability to a global audience. This feature allows users to translate text into their preferred language, increasing accessibility.

Application Flow:
1. Home Page:
Users can input articles or upload PDF documents for summarization. A reference summary (optional) can be provided for comparison.

2. Summarize Page:
This page allows users to see the extracted or generated summary using the selected NLP algorithm.

3. Speech Page:
Users can paste summarized text to convert it into speech, facilitating hands-free content consumption.

4. Translate Page:
Summarized content can be translated into multiple languages, making it accessible to non-English speakers.

Results:
1. Extractive Summarization:
TextRank: Produced a summary with a moderate BLEU score.
LexRank: Achieved a low BLEU score, indicating poor alignment with the reference summary.
Luhn: Provided relatively better performance with a BLEU score higher than LexRank.
LSA: Struggled with latent semantics, showing a very low BLEU score.
2. Abstractive Summarization:
T5: Generated a summary with moderate precision but faced challenges in maintaining coherence.
BART: Outperformed other models with the highest BLEU score, demonstrating its ability to produce high-quality, contextually rich summaries.

Conclusion:
This project contributes to the growing field of text summarization, offering a comprehensive comparison of six NLP algorithms (four extractive and two abstractive). The BART model emerged as the most effective abstractive method, excelling in both precision and the preservation of original meaning. This research provides valuable tools for researchers and professionals seeking to manage large volumes of text efficiently.
